# Ted's Books Online - Code Institute

## Description
This is an ecommerce website that I created.  Users are able to register an account and sign in or sign out
out their account.  Users are able to view a variety of books and can use the search box or dropdowns to filter
the search.  Users can view a full book's detail by clicking on the image or book name.  This will direct them
to a page showing the book's image, name, genre, published date, description and price.  Also users can add that
book to the cart from the main books page or the book detail page.  Users can then fill in the quantity of a book
or books then add to cart.  In the cart, the order will show and the user can change the quantity of a book.
The user can click the checkout button bringing them to the checkout page.  It will show the same order or orders
made by the user however the quantity cannot be edited, this will have to be done in the cart.

Users with an account have access to the forum page.  On this page users can discuss book by creating a new post or
adding a comment within a post.

Users with an account will also be able to access their profile page, which includes their account details and order
history.

I have started this project by creating mockups and wireframes to help give me an idea of how I was going to 
design the website across all platforms considered, laptops, iPads and mobile devices.  Below is attached my
mocks and wireframes:

## Framework
I have chosen to use Bootstrap 4 for the design and layout of my website.  Bootstrap is effective, very efficient to use
and suited the styling of this website.

I have also used the Django framework including jinja templates to also help me create this website.

For the font used, I have used Roboto from Google Fonts.  I have used this font as it is clear and  can be easily read 
by users.

## Deployment
This application was deployed using Heroku which can be viewed from here: 
...

I have used GitPod to build this application and close to the end of finishing up.  This was pushed
to Heroku through the command line by linking the master git from my remote GitHub repository to a 
new app created in Heroku.

There are no differences between the website's development version and the deployed version to Heroku.

### Deploying to Heroku:
1. Go to the Heroku website [here](https://id.heroku.com/login).
2. Sign Up or Sign In which will direct you to the dashboard.
3. Click on **New > Create new app**.
4. Enter app name and choose region then press **Create App**.
5. Go to **Settings > Reveal Config Vars**:
    - Enter Keys and their values, example keys below:

6. In the CLI, login into Heroku by **heroku login -i**, where you will be asked to your enter email address and
    password.
7. If you have already created your Heroku app, you can remote to your local repository with the heroku git:remote command.
8. Set debug=False for deployment.
9. To deploy your app to Heroku, use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s master branch to 
    your heroku remote:
